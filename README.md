  Filtering Water Depth Sensors in the Huron River Watershed Area
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
  
  The Digital Water Lab has deployed over 100 depth sensors in the Michigan area. The goal of this project is to filter out any sensor locations that are outside of the Huron River Watershed. In addition to such, greater filtration steps are taken to remove sensors that are not located on or near the Huron River itself. This filtration algorithm allows one to automatically determine which depth sensors are relevant to be added to the [Huron River Watershed](https://www.huron.digitalwaterlab.org/) with ease.
